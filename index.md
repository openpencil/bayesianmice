##### Abstract
Receipt of broad-spectrum antibiotics enhances _Candida albicans_ colonization of the GI tract, a risk factor for haematogenously-disseminated candidiasis. To understand how antibiotics influence _C. albicans_ colonization, we treated mice orally with vancomycin or a combination of penicillin, streptomycin, and gentamicin (PSG) and then inoculated them with _C. albicans_ by gavage. Only PSG treatment resulted in sustained, high-level GI colonization with _C. albicans_. Furthermore, PSG reduced bacterial diversity in the colon much more than vancomycin. Both antibiotic regimens significantly reduced IL-17A, IL-21, IL-22 and IFN-c mRNA levels in the terminal ileum but had limited effect on the GI fungal microbiome. Through a series of models that employed Bayesian model averaging, we investigated the associations between antibiotic treatment, GI microbiota, and host immune response and their collective impact on _C. albicans_ colonization. Our analysis revealed that bacterial genera were typically associated with either _C. albicans_ colonization or altered cytokine expression but not with both. The only exception was Veillonella, which was associated with both increased _C. albicans_ colonization and reduced IL-21 expression. Overall, antibiotic-induced changes in the bacterial microbiome were much more consistent determinants of _C. albicans_ colonization than either the GI fungal microbiota or the GI immune response.
